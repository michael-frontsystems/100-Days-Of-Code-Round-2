# #100DaysOfCode (Round 2)

## Daily logs for R2

This is my second round of #100DaysOfCode. My focus for this round is to learn more about Xamarin, C# and Prism which my current bread and butter. The plan is to learn the basics of MVVM and prism and the end result of this challenge will be a xamarin version of my old native ios app.
